<h1>G.E.E.T.A – Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 2025</p>

<p>
G.E.E.T.A (“the App”) is an offline expense tracking assistant designed to help expatriates manage their personal expenses in multiple currencies such as AED and INR. This Privacy Policy explains how your data is handled, stored, and protected.
</p>

<h2>1. No Data Leaves Your Device</h2>
<p>
The App is fully offline. All expense data, categories, and settings are stored locally on your device only.
</p>

<h2>2. No External Servers</h2>
<p>
We do not collect, store, transmit, or process any personal data on external servers.
</p>

<h2>3. Optional iCloud Backup</h2>
<p>
If enabled, your expense data is backed up only to your personal iCloud account associated with your Apple ID.  
The developer does not have access to any iCloud data.
</p>

<h2>4. No Analytics or Tracking</h2>
<p>
The App does not use:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Advertising trackers</li>
    <li>Analytics SDKs</li>
    <li>Crash reporting tools</li>
    <li>Third-party data collection services</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. No Account or Login Required</h2>
<p>
You can use the App immediately without signing up or sharing any personal information.
</p>

<h2>6. Data Export</h2>
<p>
The App provides an option to export your expense data as JSON.  
This file is generated locally on your device and not uploaded anywhere.
</p>

<h2>7. Data Deletion</h2>
<p>
Uninstalling the app permanently deletes all stored data from your device.  
If iCloud backup was enabled, you may optionally delete the backup via your iCloud settings.
</p>

<h2>8. Contact</h2>
<p>
If you have questions or need support, you may contact the developer at:<br>
